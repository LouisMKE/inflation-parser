## Usage

The user can only enter up to 18 characters of numbers in the input fields. The user can choose between the years of 1792 through 2023 (April 4th, 1792 is when the U.S. established the current currency system).

The user has three options to access inflation information:

1. Today's Dollar: The first option allows the user to input today's dollar amount inside the input field. Next the user can use the dropdown menu to select any year between 1792 through 2023 to generate the amount their dollar would be worth during the time period for the selected year.

2. Yesterday's Dollar: The second option allows the user choose a year between 1792 through 2023 to see how much a dollar would be worth in the selected year.

3. Whenever's Dollar: The third option allows the user to input today's dollar amount inside the input field, then click the "Random Year" button to generate how much the amount would be in the random year that is generated.

The user can verify the information generated is accurate by clicking on the "Sources" button, which will send them to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

The user can view the results of all their queries by selecting the "View Conversion History" button at the bottom of the website.
