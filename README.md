Description
Given the turbulent times of today's economy, wouldn't it be nice to have factual data at your fingertips to back up your frustration? That is where the Inflation Conversion Tool comes to the rescue! With the Inflation Conversion Tool you can quickly calculate how much the U.S. dollar was worth throughout history based on the actual rates of inflation. You can now go back in time to see how much your dollar today was worth in the year 1901. In 2023 the median price of a home in the U.S. was over $400,000. The same home would have only been $166,330 in the year 1990! Through the power of this website the user can now justify their anger and rage about inflation with historical data.

Usage
The user can only enter up to 18 characters of numbers in the input fields. The user can choose between the years of 1792 through 2023 (April 4th, 1792 is when the U.S. established the current currency system).

The user has three options to access inflation information:

1 - Today's Dollar: The first option allows the user to input today's dollar amount inside the input field. Next the user can use the dropdown menu to select any year between 1792 through 2023 to generate the amount their dollar would be worth during the time period for the selected year.

2 - Yesterday's Dollar: The second option allows the user choose a year between 1792 through 2023 to see how much a dollar would be worth in the selected year.

3 - Whenever's Dollar: The third option allows the user to input today's dollar amount inside the input field, then click the "Random Year" button to generate how much the amount would be in the random year that is generated.

The user can verify the information generated is accurate by clicking on the sources button, which will send them to the CPI calculator by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

The user can view the results of all their queries by selecting the "View Conversion History" button at the bottom of the website.

The user can also contact the creative geniuses of the website by hitting the "Contact Us" button at the bottom of the page. A pop-up will then allow them to select which genius they want to contact.
